Feature: Add a new activity to an itinerary

Goal: Test if a user can create a new activity inside an existing itinerary.

2. Click “Add Activity” or the "+" icon.
3. Fill in the activity title (e.g., “Visit the beach”), time, and notes.
4. Click “Save”.

Expected Result:

- The time and notes should display correctly.
- The activity should be editable or deletable afterward.
