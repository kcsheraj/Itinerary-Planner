Feature: Share an itinerary with another user

Goal: Test if a user can share an existing itinerary with another user via email.

Steps:
1. Go to the Dashboard page.
2. Select an existing itinerary (e.g., “Spring Break”).
3. Click the “Share” button/icon.
4. Enter the email of another user (e.g., testuser@example.com).
5. Set permissions (Viewer or Editor).
6. Click “Share”.

Expected Result:
- The itinerary should show that it has been shared.
- The invited user should see the itinerary on their dashboard when they log in.
- Proper permission levels should apply (e.g., Viewer cannot edit).

Tester: Sara L. (External User)  
Feedback: “Sharing worked fine! It would be nice if it confirmed the email was valid before clicking ‘Share’.”
